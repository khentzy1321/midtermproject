        <h1>About Mater Dei College</h1>
        <p className="lead">
        Founded in 1983, Mater Dei College is a school that is committed to serving the economically disadvantaged youth through quality yet affordable education. </p>

        <p className="lead">
        It is a modest but Mater Dei College was born out of
         the need for poor students to have access to college education. 
          the school’s establishment, options were very limited and local 
          residents could not afford to send their children to college in Tagbilaran, 
          the capital of Cebu.-looking college in Tubigon, Bohol. The school’s lush green 
          surroundings are a welcome contrast to the technological advancement it strives for 
          within its buildings. Parents and students are drawn to the school’s peaceful rural ambience, 
          which is conducive to learning. </p>
